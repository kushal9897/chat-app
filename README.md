Personal Project: Chat Application (Day 01)
Overview
This project is focused on creating a simple chat application using Node.js with a Kubernetes setup to manage the deployment and scaling of the application. It is part of a larger ongoing effort to explore cloud-native development, automation, and deployment techniques. The goal is to provide a robust foundation for building scalable and manageable chat apps, with future plans to integrate ArgoCD or GitOps to automate deployments and configurations.

Project Goals
Day 01: Set up the basic Node.js application.
Day 02 and beyond: Explore containerization, Kubernetes, and automation strategies like GitOps to manage infrastructure.
What’s in this repository:
Chat application built with Node.js.
Docker files to containerize the application.
Kubernetes manifests (e.g., deployment.yaml, service.yaml) for managing the app in a Kubernetes cluster.
Future integration: Plan to incorporate ArgoCD for CI/CD automation and GitOps workflow.
Technologies Used
Node.js - The runtime environment for building the backend of the chat app.
Express.js - The web framework used to build the chat app's API.
Docker - Used to containerize the application.
Kubernetes - For managing the deployment and scaling of the app.
ArgoCD/GitOps (Future integration) - Will be used for automated deployment and continuous integration.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:
Node.js installed locally (version >= 14.x)
Docker installed for building the application container
Kubernetes (Minikube, Docker Desktop, or another local cluster) running on your machine
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-app.git
cd chat-app
2. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Node.js dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
3. Dockerize the Application
To build and run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t chat-app .
Run the Docker container:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 3000:3000 chat-app
4. Deploy to Kubernetes
Create the Kubernetes deployment and service resources using the following commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
Expose the service to your localhost (if using NodePort):

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get svc chat-app-service
Then, open the app on your browser using the exposed port, e.g., http://localhost:3010.

Future Goals (GitOps & ArgoCD Integration)
Automation with ArgoCD: In the future, the goal is to set up ArgoCD for continuous delivery. This will allow the application’s Kubernetes deployment to be automatically updated when changes are pushed to the repository, using a GitOps workflow.

CI/CD Pipeline: We will create an automated CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy the Docker image, as well as deploy the changes to the Kubernetes cluster automatically using ArgoCD.
